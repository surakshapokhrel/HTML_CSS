    Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of
    making web pages presentable.

    CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of
    fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are
    used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other
    effects.

    CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most
    commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.

        CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style
        for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.

        Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write
        one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.
